The hero probably gets sent on missions, like in ProgressQuest:

"Fetch me the {artifact name} from {location}"
"Fetch me the {artifact name} from {antagonist name}"

Missions can have sub-missions

"Before I give you the {artifact name}, you must do the following things for me: {mission list}"

A mission may have prerequisites and a list of post-condition states, which may include inventory items, or attributes

A mission might consume items (burn The Golden Fleece on the Altar of Hera)

During a mission, items in the inventory might be used(up) - "Dagrec drank a potion of healing, leaving him with 3 potions remaining".
