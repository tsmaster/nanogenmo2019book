Chapter 15 : Resolutions
---

And then Marlin Z returned to Pulikeb and to Sornegia Simezsey.
Pulikeb seemed smaller, somehow. Sornegia Simezsey seemed older
and wiser.

Marlin counted his treasure. It consisted of:
1087 copper pieces
663 mithril coins
7919 platinum pieces
5549 electrum pieces
3870 silver pieces
2750 gold pieces
1 helmet
1 lady fingers whip

They all lived happily ever after. That is the end of the story,
until we tell another tale.
