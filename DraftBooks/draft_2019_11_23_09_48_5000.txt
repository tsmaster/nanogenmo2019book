Chapter 13 : Resolutions
---

And then Nimretk Silto returned to Torquay and to Stokh Female
hapbits. Torquay seemed smaller, somehow. Stokh Female hapbits
seemed older and wiser.

Nimretk counted her treasure. It consisted of:
6517 gold pieces
3149 platinum pieces
1744 electrum pieces
347 copper pieces
6015 silver pieces
1 helmet
1 sword
814 mithril coins
1 rope

They all lived happily ever after. That is the end of the story,
until we tell another tale.
